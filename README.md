# Project 0

This is my project0 for the CS50 online course. It is essentially a blog page for animations, that I created.
The "video" folder contains my animations
The "CSS files" contains my .css and .scss files
The "Pictures" contains my bio pic and my logo 
There a four pages:
  1. index.html - that's the homepage
  2. animation.html - that's the animations page
  3. youtube.html - that's my youtube handle
  4. instagram.html - that's my instagram handle
   I hope you enjoy it :)
